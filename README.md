# Quotes App
A web app where the user can save quotes.

## Build with
* Node.js
* Express
* MongoDB
* Docker

## About
With this simple project, I wanted to practice the use of Docker in development. For that, I made a simple API with just the basics of CRUD operations.

## Setup
To use this app you must have docker and docker-composer installed. 

First clone this repository, start docker-composer:

```
docker-composer up --build
```

And then the API can be accessed on localhost:5555/
