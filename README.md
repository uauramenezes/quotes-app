## About
With this simple project, I wanted to use PostgreSQL and SQL in development with Node.js.

For that, I made an app with a minimalistic design, using just HTML, CSS and JavaScript. And just the some of the CRUD operations, the user can create, delete and search quotes.

With it, I also practised the use of SQL to query the database.
